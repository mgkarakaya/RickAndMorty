Implemented best practices using Android Architecture Components

ViewModel
LiveData
Glide(image downloader, has built in cache)
Kotlin Coroutines
Retrofit
Navigation
Hilt (for dependency injection)

Room : Given more time I would prefer implement it, as a object-mapping library that provides local data persistence.
